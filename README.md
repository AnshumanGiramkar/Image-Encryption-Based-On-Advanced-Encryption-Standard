# Image-Encryption-Based-On-Advanced-Encryption-Standard

## Overview

This Java project provides a secure and efficient solution for encrypting and decrypting image files in popular formats, including JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, and HEIC. The project uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your image data. Whether you want to protect sensitive images or decrypt encrypted ones, this application offers an Java-AWT-based user-friendly interface for seamless operations.

## Features

- **Format Support:** Encrypt and decrypt image files in JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, and HEIC formats.
- **AES Encryption:** Utilize the robust AES algorithm for strong encryption, ensuring your data remains secure.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive Java-AWT-based graphical user interface for easy navigation and operations.
- **Encryption and Decryption:** Protect your images by encrypting them and decrypt them back to their original form when needed.
- **Security:** Assured confidentiality and data integrity, making it safe for storing and transmitting sensitive images.
